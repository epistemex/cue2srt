# EXAMPLE TEMPLATE FILE
#
# Lines starting with # are comment lines and will be removed.
# The keyword TITLE (upper-case) will be replaced with actual title of track.
# The keyword ARTIST (upper-case) will be replaced with actual artist of track.
# If HTML tags works depends entirely on the software reading the SRT file,
# for example, if may work in VLC but not in simpler software. Use at own risk.
#
# Also notice that the last line is not an empty line. cue2srt will insert a
# blank line automatically.
